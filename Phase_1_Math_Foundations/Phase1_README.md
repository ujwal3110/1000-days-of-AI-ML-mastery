🚀 PHASE 1 — Math & Fundamentals
Day 1 — Vectors & Dot Product

Building AI From First Principles — One Day at a Time
Welcome to Day 1 of my 1000 Days of AI/ML Mastery journey.

Phase 1 is all about raw foundations — but not by reading theory.
👉 I will build the foundations myself, piece by piece.

Today begins the construction of a mini-NumPy, a math engine that will later power:

neural networks

attention layers

optimizers

embeddings

backpropagation

full deep learning frameworks

📘 What I Learned Today
🔹 Vector Concepts

What a vector represents: geometry, magnitude, direction

Scalar vs vector intuition

Why vectors are the fundamental building block of all ML

🔹 Dot Product Intuition

Dot product as a measure of alignment

positive → same direction

negative → opposite

zero → orthogonal

Projection interpretation

Use cases in ML:

similarity search

embeddings

gradient calculations

attention mechanisms

🧠 What I Built Today
📁 File
foundations/math/vector.py

🔧 Implemented Functions

add(v1, v2) → vector addition

dot(v1, v2) → dot product

Input validation: shape + type checks

📦 Vector Class

Implemented:

__init__

__repr__

__len__

element access (__getitem__)

internal storage as Python list

This is the first building block for:

matrix operations

neural networks

gradient computation

backprop engine (coming soon)

🧪 Experiments

Created an experiment notebook to visualize vector operations.

📁 File:

experiments/day1_vector_experiments.ipynb


Included:

testing dot product with various orientations

validating geometric interpretation using angle formula

plotting 2D vectors using matplotlib

visualization showing positive/negative/zero dot-product scenarios

Screenshots added to assets/day1/

🎯 Plan for Tomorrow (Day 2)

Implement additional vector operations:

scalar multiplication

subtraction

magnitude

normalization

Complete full Vector API

Prepare for Matrix class implementation starting Day 4

🌅 Daily Reflection

Day 1 may feel small, but this is where mastery begins.

A simple vector is the seed from which
→ Matrices
→ Linear layers
→ Transformers
→ Attention
→ Entire LLMs
grow.

By building everything from first principles, I’m not just learning AI —
I’m becoming an AI engineer who can create, debug, and innovate at the lowest level.

This journey is about depth, discipline, and craftsmanship.
Onward to Day 2. 🚀
